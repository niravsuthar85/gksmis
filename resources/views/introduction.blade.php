             <p class="pt-1 text-justify">Birth of a child is often a celebration in India. Dreams are nurtured for a lifetime since the birth. Education is very much an important part of individual's upbringing and fulfilling of these dreams. Unfortunately the present day education system is yet to achieve that perfect state. There is a big void in the present day education system and the demands of the job market.The education system lacks and does not encompass the industrial demands and subject that are relevantly required to meet today's job requirements. Moreover the system also lacks upgradation of course module and practical training to master requirements of the job world. This is one of the major reasons why confidence of the educated youth and the unemployed is seriously dented.</p>
             <br/>
             <p class="pt-1 text-justify">In order to overcome this situation, Government of Gujarat came up with a revolutionary measure to bridge the gap between requirements of educational system and industries. Here, specially customized short term courses are prepared that can be easily provided to the common man at a nominal rate. To implement and take these specially customized programmes to every corner of the state of Gujarat, the Gujarat Knowledge Society is instituted.</p>
             <br/>
             <p class="pt-1 text-justify">Gujarat Knowledge Society aims to empower the youth for accessing better employment opportunities in the age of knowledge based economy.</p>
